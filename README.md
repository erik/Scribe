# Scribe

A Clojure application in the works. Nothing is final, nothing is promised to work, etc.

## About

FIXME: write

## Installation

I wouldn't suggest using this until it reaches an actual release. Still in very rough stage. If you really want to however, clone the repo, run lein deps, then ./scribe

## License

As of now, there is none. This will probably change when a more final version is released
